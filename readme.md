# Limiting Serial Dilutions
The _objective_ of this tool is to estimate with high confidence the number of targets (viable cells/genomes/detectable targets) from a limiting serial dilution of this starting material. A serial dilution is said to be _limiting_ if we fully dilute out the starting sample, that is, we expect to see _empty_ wells at some point in the dilution.

Serial dilutions are modeled as a Poisson process. We use the fact that for an expected number of events `x`, the probability of failure to observe an event is given by

Poisson(0 events | x) = e^(-x)

In a serial diution starting from x cells, the Probability of seeing observing any target, i.e. >0 events can thus be written as 

Poisson(>0 events | x) = 1- e^(-x)


If we are performing an `f` fold serial dilution, the process can be represented as 
product_i=1^(i=k) (Poisson(growth observed well | x/f^k ) for `k` serial dilutions.


We construct the Log Likelihood function as follows
$$L = \prod_{r=1}^{r=R} \prod_{d=1}^{d=D} (1 - e^{-x/F^d})^{v_{rd}} (e^{-x/F^d})^{1-v_{rd}}$$

We find the number of cells x that maximizes the Log Likelihood.

Further, using the Cramer-Rao bound, we estimate the variance at the MLE to be 

$$\text{Variance} = \frac{-1}{\frac{\partial^2 \ln L}{\partial x^2}$$

where

$$\frac{\partial^2 \ln L}{\partial x^2} = \sum_{r=1}^{r=R} \sum_{d=1}^{d=D}- \frac{F^{- 2 d} v_{rd} e^{- F^{- d} x}}{1 - e^{- F^{- d} x}} - \frac{F^{- 2 d} v_{rd} e^{- 2 F^{- d} x}}{\left(1 - e^{- F^{- d} x}\right)^{2}}$$

Finally, we compute the 95% CI as MLE $$\pm 1.96 \sqrt \sigma$$
